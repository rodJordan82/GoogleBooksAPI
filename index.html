<!-- To whom it may concern,

While my code in this example is not amazing or complex...or even standardised to the normal extent, this project was a headache for me, as I, on multiple occassions had stupid little typos that took me days to figure out.

This is not my best work, nor is it even something I'm happy with submitting, but I need to stop writing this code for a couple days just for my own sanity.

I just want you to know that, I don't expect it to make a difference, there is lots to clean up in this.
And I was looking forward to the modal part but I only barely have working code, at 9am today, this was still not even working.

I've put a week of effort in but I think only 3 hours has not been trying to fix my fetch code (except I was looking in the wrong place for the bug, I thought I was messing up fetch, but it was, on both occassions, typos in the rest of my code.) -->
